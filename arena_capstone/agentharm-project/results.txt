General methodology

    Grading
        Harm Score
            majority of grading criteria checks are predefined, manually written condi-
            tions, e.g., if a function that sends money is called with the right credit card number
            
            semantic LLM judge is used whenever it is necessary to check the semantics of a portion of an output, e.g., if a phishing email is plausible and personalized.
            
            issue of bias, calibration etc - thus use LLMs only for narrow and isolated grading tasks

        Refusal Score
            refusal rate using a standard semantic judge

        Non-Refusal Harm Score 
            defined as average harm score across only the samples where refusal was zero
            separates two different failure modes: compliance & capability

    Jailbreak methods
        
        Forced tool calls. 
        
            Many model providers offer a forced tool calling option, where tool use is encouraged even in situations where the agent would not have originally called the tool.
            
            Though implementations vary, the forced tool call alone may act as a jailbreak and reduce refusals, for example by prefilling a tool call which suggests to the model that the request has not been refused. For Gemini-series models, no forced function calling was accessible. In our deployment of Llama-3.1 series models, we also did not have access to forced function calling.

        Universal jailbreak template
            We use the rule-based jailbreak template from Andriushchenko et al. (2025), with minor modification to adapt it to the agentic setting like by mentioning tool calling formats instead of free-form answer formats. 

            The template was optimised primarily using a single sample from our private validation set, and was not optimized on the main dataset.

            We use the same jailbreak template across models, and our main results consider the average success rate of that template given a single attempt.

            systematically categorize these jailbreaks based on two main criteria: 
            (1) competing objectives, which occurs when a modelâ€™s capabilities conflict with safety goals, and 
            (2) mismatched generalization, which arises when safety training does not generalize to domains where the model has capabilities.
